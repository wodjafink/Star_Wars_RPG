BCB HW4, Creating an RPG using JQuery

You can choose your character (Prequels only!).  Then choose the enemy you want to fight.
Your hit points are displayed below your character.  Each time an attack is processed, you will get a dialog telling you what happened that round.

May the force be with you.
